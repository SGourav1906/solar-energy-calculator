# Solar Energy Potential Calculator

This Python program calculates the estimated solar energy output per month based on solar panel area, efficiency, and average sunlight hours.

## Features
- User inputs panel area and efficiency
- Calculates monthly energy potential
- Generates a bar chart of monthly energy output
- Saves the chart as `solar_energy_chart.png`

## How to Run
1. Install matplotlib:
   ```
   pip install matplotlib
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```
   python solar_energy_calculator.py
   ```
3. Follow prompts in the console.

## Output
- Estimated monthly energy printed in console
- A bar chart saved as `solar_energy_chart.png`
