# Solar Energy Potential Calculator

This Python project calculates the estimated solar energy output per month based on solar panel area, efficiency, and average sunlight hours.

## Features
- User inputs panel area and efficiency interactively
- Calculates monthly energy production based on standard sunlight hours
- Generates a professional bar chart of monthly energy
- Saves the chart as `solar_energy_chart.png`
- Easy-to-run script for beginners

## How to Run

1. **Install required packages:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Python script:**
   ```
   python solar_energy_calculator.py
   ```

3. **Follow the prompts to input your solar panel details.**

## Example Output

A bar chart will be saved as `solar_energy_chart.png` after running the script.

## Why This Project?
This project demonstrates the application of Python for solving real-world energy problems, useful for technical interviews showcasing coding + domain knowledge.
